`Cafecito Sprint`_ is taking place right now in SÃ£o Paulo to release a package
to create front pages. Intended audience is mainly news sites and intranets.

You can `see and comment our mockups online`_.

We want to solve the following use cases:

- a front page may have different layouts
- the package will provide some layouts by default
- layouts are created by Site Administrators
- front page layouts can be independently edited from templates
- layouts are made of groups of tiles
- groups of tiles may have different editing permissions
- a Site Administrator can drag&drop tiles and groups of tiles around the
  layout
- only users with specific permissions can modify the content a group of tiles
- a user can associate content to a tile using a simple drag&drop metaphor
- a user can easily edit the content on a tile in place
- front page edition take place on a working copy of the object
- a front page can have versions
- it will be easy to implement a responsive design for a front page

Over the years there have been some packages to solve the problem of creating
front pages in Plone; we have used and are taking ideas from the following::

`CompositePack`_
    Very old; the legacy code is so complex that is not maintainable anymore.
    It has (arguably) the best user interface of all. Layouts can not be
    created TTW. Viewlets are just page templates associated with content
    types; you can drag&drop viewlets around the layout. Publishers love it.

`CMFContentPanels`_
    Very old, but still maintained.

`Collage`_
    It allows to create layouts TTW but it has (arguably) the worst user
    interface of all. It is easily extended and there are several add-ons
    available that provide new functionality for it.

collective.composition
    This package. Some months ago `Carlos de la Guardia`_ was comisioned to
    update `CompositePack`_ and make it run on Plone 4. He succeeded, but the
    package proved to be hard to maintain and no further features could be
    added. Carlos then started collective.composition implementing the best
    ideas of `CompositePack`_ using new technologies like Dexterity. We ran
    out of money and the work stopped for many months. Now the picture is
    completely different and many things have become clearer. We are using
    some of the code, but we are going to replace old concepts with new ones.
